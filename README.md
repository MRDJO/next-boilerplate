# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a Next.js boilerplate for building modern web applications, with a focus on dashboard-style interfaces. It comes pre-configured with a set of tools and conventions to help you get started quickly.

## Architecture

The project follows a feature-based architecture using the Next.js App Router.

*   **`src/app`**: This directory contains the application's routes, layouts, and pages, following the Next.js App Router conventions.
*   **`src/components`**: This directory is for all React components, organized into `ui` for generic, reusable components (from shadcn/ui) and other custom components.
*   **`src/features`**: This is where the core business logic resides. It's divided by feature (e.g., `app`, `user`), with each feature having its own actions, queries, data models, and state management.
*   **`src/lib`**: This directory contains shared utilities and library configurations.
*   **`src/hooks`**: This directory is for custom React hooks.

## Data Fetching

Data fetching is handled through a centralized system in the `src/features` directory.

*   **Queries and Actions**: Each feature defines its own data-fetching logic in `*.repository.ts`,   `*.services.ts` and `*.actions.ts` files. This keeps the data logic co-located with the feature it belongs to.
*   **State Management**: The project uses [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for global state management, configured on a per-feature basis (e.g., `src/features/app/app.store.ts`).

## Components

The project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for its component library. The following components are available in `src/components/ui`:

*   avatar
